			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

Hours Spent:
Daniel: 4
Kevin:
Andrew: 6.5

Focus
Daniel: Wrote the main() function for the shell and implemented the built-in
        functions cd and exit. Also implemented multiline commands.
Kevin: Wrote the parser TODO
Andrew: Wrote the startChildren() function that takes in a parsed command structure,
        and starts the child process.  Handles creating pipes, forking children,  
        redirecting IO, and waiting for children to terminate.
---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Describe how your command shell manages parsing and executing
>> commands that contain arguments and pipes, using the example
>> command "a arg1 arg2 | b arg1 | c arg1 arg2 arg3".  How does your
>> shell internally represent such a command?

TODO how 2 parse

The command will be represented as the following.  Shorthand array notation
will be used to represent this, though the underlying structure is made of
c pointer arrays and structs.

{
    inputStream: STDIN_FILENO
    outputStream: STDOUT_FILENO
    nCmds: 3
    cmds: [
        {
            argc: 3,
            argv: ["a", "arg1", "arg2"]
        },
        {
            argc: 2,
            argv: ["b", "arg1"]
        },
        {
            argc: 3,
            argv: ["c", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]
        }
    ]
}

This struct will be handled by the startChildren() function. The initial input 
stream will be set to the one specified in the struct, which is stdin.  The 
programs are forked off one at a time in order, and pipes are created as needed.
The final pipe is not created, and just set to the output stream specified in
the struct, which is stdout.

>> A2: Now, given the command:
>> "a arg1 arg2 < inp.txt | b arg1 | c arg1 arg2 arg3 > out.txt"
>> Briefly explain specifically how the redirections are parsed and
>> represented, and by what processes.


TODO
{
    inputStream: (file descriptor for inp.txt)
    outputStream: (file descriptor for out.txt)
    nCmds: 3
    cmds: [
        {
            argc: 3,
            argv: ["a", "arg1", "arg2"]
        },
        {
            argc: 2,
            argv: ["b", "arg1"]
        },
        {
            argc: 3,
            argv: ["c", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]
        }
    ]
}

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A3: Illustrate how you solved the problem of setting up
>> redirection in a simple command like "a < inp.txt > out.txt", by
>> describing what process takes care of the redirection and when.

The shell process will open the file descriptors for the inp.txt and
out.txt files.  The shell process forks, and the parent will close
the file descriptors.  The child process will set those handles as
its input and output stream.  We then run the new program, and that
code will be responsible for closing the streams.

>> A4: Illustrate how you solved the problem of setting up the pipes
>> between multiple operations in a single command, by describing
>> what each process is responsible for.  For example, given the
>> command "a | b | c", describe the sequence of steps in setting up

>> Keep your description of each process' responsibilities limited to
>> ~25 words or less.

Shell Process:
The input FD (stdin) already exists.  Create a pipe for a -> b.  Fork 
off "a" with the stdin and pipe fds.  We don't close stdin.  Save the 
pipe a -> b, and create a pipe for b -> c.  Start "b" with the pipes.
Close the pipe a -> b, save the pipe b -> c, and output (stdout) 
already exists.  Start "c" and close b -> c, and don't close stdout.

"a" Process:
Don't close stdin, close the input fd from a -> b pipe.  Then run the 
application.  The application will close the other direction.

"b" Process:
Close the output fd from a -> b pipe, input fd from b -> c pipe. Then 
run the app.

"c" Process:
Don't close stdout, close the output fd from b -> c pipe.  Then run the 
application.  The application will close the other direction.

>> A5: Similarly, describe the details of how terminated processes are
>> reaped in the example command "a | b | c".

The shell uses the wait() command to wait for all child processes to
terminate.  This will ensure that all children are reaped before
the user may enter the next command.

>> A6: Similarly, describe which processes are responsible for setting
>> up the redirections in the example command
>> "a < inp.txt | b | c > out.txt".

Shell Process:
The shell process will open the file descriptors for the inp.txt and
out.txt files.  Use the input fd.   Create a pipe for a -> b.  Fork 
off "a" with the inp.txt and pipe fds.  We close the inp.txt.  Save the 
pipe a -> b, and create a pipe for b -> c.  Start "b" with the pipes.
Close the pipe a -> b, save the pipe b -> c, and output out.txt fd
already exists.  Start "c" and close b -> c, and don't close out.txt.

"a" Process:
Don't close the file fd, close the input fd from a -> b pipe.  Then run the 
application.  The application will close the other direction.

"b" Process:
Close the output fd from a -> b pipe, input fd from b -> c pipe. Then 
run the app.

"c" Process:
Don't close the file fd, close the output fd from b -> c pipe.  Then run the 
application.  The application will close the other direction.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A7: Why must the chdir and exit commands be implemented as built-in
>> functions, rather than external programs?

UNIX does not provide for cd as a seperate utility because cd must change
the working directory state of the shell program.  Any child program started
by the shell does not have access to its parent, so the child will not be 
able to edit its parent's state.

Similarly, a child process cannot easily tell the parent process, the shell
to terminate.  The shell must have a command to terminate itself.

>> A8: Why did you ultimately choose this design?  In what ways is it
>> superior to other designs you considered as you developed your solution?

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)
