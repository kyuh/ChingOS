			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

Hours Spent:
Daniel: 4
Kevin:
Andrew:

Focus
Daniel: Wrote the main() function for the shell and implemented the built-in
        functions cd and exit. Also implemented multiline commands.
Kevin: Wrote the parser TODO
Andrew: Wrote the piper TODO
---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Describe how your command shell manages parsing and executing
>> commands that contain arguments and pipes, using the example
>> command "a arg1 arg2 | b arg1 | c arg1 arg2 arg3".  How does your
>> shell internally represent such a command?

TODO

>> A2: Now, given the command:
>> "a arg1 arg2 < inp.txt | b arg1 | c arg1 arg2 arg3 > out.txt"
>> Briefly explain specifically how the redirections are parsed and
>> represented, and by what processes.

TODO

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A3: Illustrate how you solved the problem of setting up
>> redirection in a simple command like "a < inp.txt > out.txt", by
>> describing what process takes care of the redirection and when.

TODO

>> A4: Illustrate how you solved the problem of setting up the pipes
>> between multiple operations in a single command, by describing
>> what each process is responsible for.  For example, given the
>> command "a | b | c", describe the sequence of steps in setting up
>> the processes and their pipes, starting with your command shell's
>> process, and going through the execution of programs a, b and c.
>> Keep your description of each process' responsibilities limited to
>> ~25 words or less.

TODO

>> A5: Similarly, describe the details of how terminated processes are
>> reaped in the example command "a | b | c".

TODO

>> A6: Similarly, describe which processes are responsible for setting
>> up the redirections in the example command
>> "a < inp.txt | b | c > out.txt".

TODO

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A7: Why must the chdir and exit commands be implemented as built-in
>> functions, rather than external programs?

UNIX does not provide programs for cd and exit in /bin since these two commands
also need dedicated hardware support to be implemented. NEEDS CHECK

>> A8: Why did you ultimately choose this design?  In what ways is it
>> superior to other designs you considered as you developed your solution?

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

>> Any other comments?
